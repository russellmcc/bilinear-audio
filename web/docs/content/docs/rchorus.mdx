## Overview

Chorus-R is a growing collection of chorus effects based on historical chorus effects designed by a certain Japanese company.
We plan to add more effects over time.

The plug-in is currently available only in the VST3 format for macOS.

## Effects

### C-3P

C-3P is a mono-to-stereo chorus effect inspired by a built-in chorus effect included in a synthesizer released in 1983.

It uses delay modulation synchronized between the stereo channels to provide a deep chorus effect without an obvious sense of pitch modulation.

Just like the original, the only control is whether to enable or disable the effect.

### Superdimensional Chorus

Superdimensional Chorus is a true stereo chorus effect inspired by a rack-mount chorus unit released in the late 1970s.

While it sounds similar to the C-3P when used as a mono-to-stereo effect, it provides a quite distinctive sound when the input is stereo.
