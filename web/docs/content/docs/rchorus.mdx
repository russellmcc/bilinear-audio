# Overview

Chorus-R is a stereo chorus effect based on a chorus included in a certain Japanese analog synthesizer from the early 1980s.
It uses delay modulation synchronized between the stereo channels to provide a deep chorus effect without a sense of pitch modulation.

The plug-in is currently available only in the VST3 format for macOS.

Just like the original, the only control is whether to enable or disable the effect.
