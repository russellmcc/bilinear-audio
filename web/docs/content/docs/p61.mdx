# Overview

Poly 81 is a polyphonic synthesizer inspired by a certain budget-conscious Japanese analog synthesizer from the early 1980s. While not meant to be a
faithful recreation, it does attempt to capture some of the specialness of the awkward era of transition between analog to digital synthesizers.

The plug-in is currently available only in the VST3 format for macOS.

In addition to all the features of the synth it is based on, Poly 81 includes **note expression** support which allows it to be controlled
by **MPE**-compatible controllers.
