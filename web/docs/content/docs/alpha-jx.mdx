## Overview

Alpha JX is a "what-if" analog-modeled synthesizer currently in beta. It's based on a simple question: What if the golden era of 1980s Japanese analog synthesis had lasted just a little bit longer?

Drawing on meticulous research into the engineering philosophies of a certain Hamamatsu-based manufacturer who produced their last analog instrument in 1986, Alpha JX is an imagined mid-range synth that could have plausibly debuted in early 1987.

This synth is a nostalgic celebration of an innovative design lineage that was cut short by the torrent of progress - a small act of preservation through imagination.

Here's to the ones who refuse to let time erase what deserves to be remembered. To those who keep love alive even as the years quietly wear it thin. And to those who find shelter from the storm of the now in memory, where the shadows are soft and the wounds are old.

An impossible wish, fulfilled: giving the past the future it deserved.

Please try it out, and let us know if you find any bugs or have any feedback!
