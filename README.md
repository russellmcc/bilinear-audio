# A collection of open-source audio plug-ins!

This repo contains a collection of open-source audio plug-ins written in Rust and TypeScript using the [Conformal framework](https://github.com/russellmcc/conformal)

For information on how to use the plug-ins, see our [documentation website](https://russellmcc.github.io/bilinear-audio).

This project welcomes technical and documentation contributions, but internal documentation is somewhat limited, sorry about that! If you'd
like to contribute something specific, feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/russellmcc/bilinear-audio/discussions).
